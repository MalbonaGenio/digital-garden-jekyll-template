*This is an about page. Something I am really bad at.*

I am a stationery products hoarder, bookworm, tea enthusiast, coffee roaster and I like to learn things like coding and other skills. 

This little digital garden is my way to share what I have been learning and any other interesting ideas I might encounter or discover. Notes are mainly extracted from books and articles, and posts are my own writing. 

Enjoy your stay here. You can connect with me through Twitter at [@MalbonaGenio](https://twitter.com/malbonagenio)
