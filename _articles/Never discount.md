# Never discount
It establishes a patron of behaviour/expectation. Customers excpect a discount, so they donÂ´t buy, they wait until the sale is going on. (Especially in [[retail]]) Then when the prices go up to normal they look for someone else.

This behaivour patterns can happen to in companies with in-house teams do repeating work and outside teams doing more "cool" stuff. And it can create weird dynamics.

## When to discount (exceptions)
- Best/Loyal customers
- Buy in bulk 
	- Buy multiple products, bundles of 10 or other amounts.
	- If a new customer come in and immediately ask for discount. A good strategy is to ok but for that i need you to book 3 projects now. That way you lock them in place and you get 3 projects and you can concentrate resources internally too.
- [[Test concept viability]]
	- You have a product idea an all your customers are: Take my money. But at the time of selling them usually is less than excpeted. A good way to [[Test concept viability]] is to do a kickstarter for example. To see the excpecatiton and prepare for producing the product according to demand. Rewairding the early adopters with discounts and some extra goodies maybe.
- Pre-launch 
	- For a beta course or book that is still a WIP 
- Good story (hard)
	- This are unusual or special cases, ususally at random times. f.ex If we reach 100k subs 20% to this product.
- Early payment
	- Give back a 2% of an invoice if the pay in 15 days or less. You need to factor in the 2% in your budgets or proposals. For example a 100.000â‚¬ project has to be 102.000â‚¬ If they pay you in time you give back 2000 but if not you keep them.

## Keys to discounting
Even if we recognise the deal or discount you cannot fight the psychological effect of the sale. For example 299â‚¬ discounted 50% to 149â‚¬ 

We are very compeled to buy because:
- Anchor: The 299 tag will keep you in place comparing the 299 with the 149.
	You can use the anchor in other ways too. If they ask you for a logo price. You could say, last one for a company of your size was 2k. This sets an anchor and then you can offer another value to set the anchor and start a comparison between them. Lets say 1250â‚¬

	We are very prone to [[comparison bias]]

- Scarcity: Create a sense of urgency via time or/and quantity
	Black Friday is an example of time urgency, some places will also use something similar to: **Today only** save 50% of 149â‚¬ **while supply lasts**. Or have next to the order button a 3 units left or similar.

	This triggers a [[Loss aversion bias]] or [[FOMO]]

- Decision: All this keys aproach the customer to a decision. Do I buy or not. The closer we get them to buy the least resistance they will have to make an order.

## Reverse sale
149â‚¬ to 299â‚¬ Is the anchor in this case. If for example we have a course, ebook, service and we improve it or we think we are not selling enough because the price is low and the perception of quality of the course is also low. 

We could for example email all the newsletter and social channels. Update is going out and the value of the course will rise from 149 to 299 in X days. 

This creates the conditions we have seen above and can help sell better a course that was cheaper too. Because we are changing the perception of quality of the people who wants it. 

This helps make the customers feel like the product is always the best quality as it improves overtime and also the value they get from it. It is a way to reward early adopters too.
