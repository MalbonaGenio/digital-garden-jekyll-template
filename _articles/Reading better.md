Reading is a tool that allows to distill and master what another person have figured out. But only if we remember and apply that learning.

## Quit books
Good books are: 
- well written
- organised
- packed with ideas and insigths

If itÂ´s not the case stop reading it. Skim a lot of book, read some of them and re-read the best ones.

## Types of reading
There is different degrees of intensity:

- Entertainment
- Information: superficial read, skim trough it, get an idea.
- Understanding: Read the book and digest the content
- Mastering: Just one book in one topic can lead to knowledge blind spots. Read a variety of books on the topic and form an opinon, contradictions etc

## What you absorb
Speed is a [[Vanity metrics]] what matters is what you absorb from them. Skim fast, find something worth reading. Then slow down and go deep into it.

## Material quality

Time is limited and should be directed to great content instead of the last fad or trend. Time usually filters out the most valuable content and forgets about the rest. Some new books might also be very good content but usually untested trough time and with a lot of marketing associated with them. Find great info about them on the web and decide on your opinion about them.

## Take notes
After a reading session take notes on the main ideas that stuck with you in a mind map, obsidian, or cards. With time conect this with other material you are reading. Connecting ideas trough ultiple disciplines allows to a more deep Understanding and conection within diferent subjects that might appear not related otherwise. 

Mark, wirte or make bulleted list of topics in your books too.

The most important part is to revisit those topics from time to time. Connect old knowledge and new and find knowledge blind spots to fill.

## Main points for goals
- Learn all the time, is the only path to where you want to go.
- Start small but add up the gains of your reading and learning.
- Reading does not mean you can form an opinion about something. [[The work to have an opinion]]
