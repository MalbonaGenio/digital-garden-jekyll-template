Vanity metrics always show the best possible face of an organizaton. Unlike a [[Cohort analysis]] where each month we treat the new customers as a new set of data to work. 

Vanity metrics usually are the [[gross metrics]] or [[cumulative results]]. Usually giving the impression that the [[growth model]] is working. 

[[Cohort analysis]] can show us that the engine is moving but the [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]] is not yelding good enough results.

[[Innovation accounting]] will not work whit vanity metrics as we need to evaluate the business and [[learining milestones]] or [[Actionable metrics]].
