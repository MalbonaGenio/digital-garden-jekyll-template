# Accountability framework
Traditional accounting is historically and way to centralise control over divisions in large organizations. Binding a set of clear goals to the managers of the divisions and keeping them accountable in reaching these goals.

A [[Startup]] enviroment is too unpredictable to forecast and to have accurate milestones. Most times milestones are set in a way such as product milestones, getting feedback and raising the number of customers etc. This kind of progress is not a good indicator as we cannot be sure if the changes made to the product are related to the result we are seeing. 

The startup enviroment is more suitable for a [[Innovation accounting]] framework that will bind [[Leap of fatith]] assumptions with a [[finacial model]] from your [[business plan]]. This model makes assumptions about how the business will look like at a succesfull point in time in the future.
