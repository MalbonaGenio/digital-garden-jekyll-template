# Pivot or persevere

When cheking if we are doing a good progress on our [[Strategy and assumptions]] we check to pivot or persevere in our strategy.

Pivoting implies a structure correction to test a new [[Strategy and assumptions]] about the product, strategy, [[growth model]] etc.

Persevering in an approach that does nothing in any way is just foolish or stubbornes and a lot of businesses fall in that trap. 

Altough the human judgment might be faulty we can improve it by testing our theories repeatedly.

Productivity is not about shipping features or more products. But putting our efforts in a business and a product that works on creating value and drives growth.
