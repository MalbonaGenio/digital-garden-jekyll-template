The MVP is what helps us to start the learning process by getting completing the first [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]] with the least effort. DoesnÂ´t strive for produt perfection but for learning purposes. It is going to be testing product desing and technical questions but also test the fundamental business hypothesis.

Most entrepreneurs and product development people overestimate the amount of features a MVP needs. Any additional feature to what is necessary to start is waste.

## Some techinques to explore
- Video MVP. Do a video to demostrate the technology/product to a target audience (usually a early adopter if in initial stages). Make it in way that you can validate your [[Leap of fatith]] assumptions.
- Concierge MVP. Serve a single customer at a time, itÂ´s not a personalized treatment but an opportunity to learn and test your [[Leap of fatith]]. It usually help to prove that the [[growth model]] is wrong and it needs a new aproach. Even if the MVP is profitable it might not be scalable. Add new automations as needed step by step following the needs/problems that come out of it.
- Behind the curtain MVP. The backend is runned by humans. Similar to the Conierge MVP, not good for scaling but very useful at very small scale. Allows to try several promissing concepts but not figthing with very difficult technical side of things. Allows to pivot over an over. When you find a good one, build features to automate an scale.

## Quality and desing roles in MVP
In many cases the main drive for a high-quality product is that all the effort is on prducing something that the customer will see as valuable. This assumes that the company already knows what attributes are percived as valuable. But itÂ´s not usually the case in startups where sometimes we even donÂ´t know about who is the customer.

Use the MVP to put to test that your assumptions are correct. If they are perfect you can continue and you will learn from it too. If they are not undertood or is poorly designed it conforms the need to use a more refined design or product overall. 

This does not mean operating in a sloppy or undisciplined way as it can slow the [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]].

Remove everything that does not contribute directly to the learning you look for.

## MVP speedbumps
Usually legal issues, fears about competitors, branding risks and morale.

- Legal issues are most of the time patent filling if a scientific breakthrough is the competitive advantage.
- Fear of competition, especially from bigger companies. Usually this big companies are too full of other ideas and plans so itÂ´s quite difficult for that to happen. If it happens once the idea is known the startup is doomed anyway. ItÂ´s all about the [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]] speed you can achive, faster than anyone. A headstart in stealth mode is usually useless. Because hidden away from customers there is almost zero learning from them and thus it slows the [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]].
- Branding risks. For internal entrepreneurs to not hinder the parent brands reputation you can just ship the MVP as another brand. This risk is only dangerous when PR or hype is overused and not delivered, especially to a corporate brand. But for startups that have so much less exposure is an advantage. Test your product an public launch once it has proven worthy with real customers.
- Morale. Shipping MVP can result in bad news too. Sometimes we are afraid of shipping a too small or limited MVP. But shipping a fully fledged product to then see them fail it can impact in the morale an even abandonment of the project in traditional product development methods.

Some solutions to the problems above is to commit to iteration. Commit to [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]] over and over ahed of time. This will help to not lose hope at the first sign of problems.

## [[Innovation accounting]]
Traditional accounting counts on managers delivering what they promise, no excuses. Failing to do so, in the eyes of [[CFO]] or [[VC]], is usually seen as:
- Failure in execution
- Failure in proper planning

In a startup enviroment where the unceratinty is high, this two mistakes can very easily happen if there is no [[pivot]] strategy from the data gathered in testing. Also it is very complex to comunicate that we failed because we learned something critical about our hypothesis. 

This is what [[Innovation accounting]] strives to help with. A systematic aproach to see if we are making progress and we are getting [[validated learning]] from it.
