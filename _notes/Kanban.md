A diagram of work as it progress from stage to stage. Shifts the mindset of productivity according to the [[validated learning]] and not to the amount of production of new features.

Usually with a maximun allowed number of tasks in each step, for example 3

"A solid process lays the foundation for a healthy culture, one where ideas are evaluated by merit not by job title" [[The Lean Startup]]

- Backlog - Pending tasks
- In progress
- Built
- Validated - A process of [[validated learning]] to see if the feaure is good or not having an impact in [[Actionable metrics]]. It can be validated trough [[AB testing]], interviews or similar.

A feature is only considered good if the [[validated learning]] and the [[Actionable metrics]] show it and if itÂ´s not the case it migth require to reevaluate [[Strategy and assumptions]]. 

The [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]] can really benefit from kanban to not disperse efforts.

Validation must be implemented from the beginning  as it saves time later on when needing to validate data etc. Making [[validated learning]] a backbone and integrating it in the product development speeds up development for the whole team, form implementation to testing to validation.

One of the most important parts is also that the teams using this system start seeing productivity acording to validated learning, not productivity of producing new features.
