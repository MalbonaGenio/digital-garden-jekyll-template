How can we be sure that the changes to a product are yielding good results? How do we know what to prioritise? Are the increase of numbers due to improvements or is another thing causing them?

ItÂ´s about improving the product day by day, but also that those improvements matter to the customer. 

Introducing the NEED to [[Learning culture]] can undermine productivity. In [[Lean Manufacturing]] we managers would optimise a machine to itÂ´s fullest but that could be unproductive as seen by the whole factory sometimes too. 

[[Systems theory]] tells us that if we optimise something to the fullest we also undermine the system as a whole.

Using wrong metrics or [[Vanity metrics]] can lead to teams to work based on those metrics, to grow them even though ot does not translate to progress or growth. If your team is higly disciplined it does not matter a lot. That team might be applying wrong methodology, but if they see the error they will shift quickly. 

A good team and a disciplined team should be able to experiment whit their own working style and get conclusions of it.

Using a [[Cohort analysis]] aproach for the metrics is good first step in finding wich ones really mater for the [[growth model]]. And itÂ´s specially usefull in the long run to [[AB testing]] your product development.
