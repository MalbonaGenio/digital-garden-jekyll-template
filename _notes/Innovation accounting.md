The startup enviroment benifits of an [[Accountability framework]] like [[Innovation accounting]].  This will bind [[Leap of fatith]] assumptions with a [[finacial model]] from your [[business plan]]. The model makes assumptions about how the business will look like at a succesfull point in time in the future.

There are three clear steps:
- Use an [[MVP]] to establish real data on the current situation. This will determine how far or close we are from our goal and help keep track of progress.
- Move the numbers from the baseline towards our ideal number. Once changes, optimizations and adjustments are done we reach a decision point.
- If progress is good it means we are leaning appropriately and using that learning apropiatley too.  Time to continue on that path. If not the managing team need to [[pivot]] the product strategy pivoting it to create a new baseline. From then repeat tuning and making changes to reach our ideal goal. If the [[pivot]] is successful the changes should be more productive than before.

## Creating a baseline
Create an [[MVP]] that test the most important [[Strategy and assumptions]] and create a baseline for each one. There is also an option to build separate [[MVP]] targeted to only one assumption. 

Before building a whole prototype an invest more money itÂ´s also possible to do a [[smoke test]]. This is done with marketing material for a product that has not yet been build. It test one single things, the interest of the customer. ItÂ´s not sufficient to validate the [[growth model]] but itÂ´s useful as a way to get feedback before investing more. 

This three will provide whit [[learining milestones]] and allow to fill in real data in the baseline of the [[growth model]]. proving a valuable foundation to know the customers and the reactions, even if they are bad.

If we are trying to get data from several assumptions test always the riskiest one or the most important one where others depend on. Because if there is no way to suitable business in the most important one is now worth to try the ones that depend on it.

## Tuning the metrics
Every initiative that the startup undertakes like [[product development]] or [[marketing]] need to be targeted to improve one of the drivers for the [[growth model]]. if they do not it should be treated as a failure.

Set a clear baseline metric, defien an hypothesis that will improve the metric and devise a set of experiments designed to test the hypotesis.

## [[Pivot or persevere]]

Learn your way towards a sustainable business. From the [[MVP]] baselines to something similar to your ideal numbers in the [[business plan]]. If we are not moving the drivers of the [[growth model]] we are not making progress and that is a sign to [[pivot]].
