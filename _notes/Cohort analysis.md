instead of looking at a cumulative totals or gross numbers like total revenue or total customers, look at the performane of a group of customers and the interaction with the product independently. 

You can track [[funnel metrics]] like customer registration, repeted use, purchase... This [[funnel analysis]] is traditional sales and product development. As it allows to understand [[customer flows]] this way there is a more quantitative understanding than traditional gross metrics.
