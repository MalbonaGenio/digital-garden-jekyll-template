Status: ðŸŒ±

A way to reverse engineer complex problems by breaking down complexity to their most basic elements and reassembling them later.

ItÂ´s a way to move from linear to non-linear results.

A First Principle is a foundational assumption that stands on their own. We cannot deduce it from another assumption.

By removing assumptions, beliefs and conventions what reamains is the essential elements of a problem.

When we know at a very fundamental level we achive real knowledge and not just [[know-how]]. The same way a cook follows a recipe [[Analogy thinking]]. And a chef understands the raw ingredients and their interactions builidng recipes from scratch [[First Principles Thinking]].

Not taking apart assumptions, test them and rebuild them it leads us into thinking like other people do. And we get trapped in that, in their possibilites, their ideas, their way of thinking.

[[First Principles Thinking]] are laws of nature to say so, the rest, laws, money and almost anything else is just shared beliefs.

## [[Socratic questioning]]
[[Socratic questioning]] is a systematic way to identify [[First Principles Thinking]] elements. This stops you from relying on beliefs and emotions as well as backlash from them.
- Question a process
- Establish truths
- Reveal underlying assumptions and separate knowledge from ignorance

1. Clear picture of what you think. Origin of your idea. Why and what I think this.
2. Challenge It. How can I know that this is true? What if I thought the opposite?
3. Look for evidences. How to back it up. What are the sources.
4. Other perspectives. What will others think. How can I be sure I am correct?
5. Consequences and implications. What If we are wrong? What are the consequences if we are wrong. 
6. Back to the original question. Why did I think I was rigth? Draw conclusions from the resutls of that process. [[validated learning]]

## Asking Whyâ€™s 
Asking Whyâ€™s can lead to usually something like "Because thatÂ´s how it is" or "Becasue I say it"

1. Usually becasue we feel it will slow us down. Explanations etc etc friction
2. After going trough them we can get lost and switch to self-defence due to our own ignorance.

Avoid applying [[Analogy thinking]] to any thing that is new because it will never let you do anything new.

Reduce concepts to [[First Principles Thinking]] elements. Ignore unnecessary details that lead to waste. [[Value vs Waste]] Keep going to what is essential to your bussines or idea. 

When we let others think for us we limit our own thinking to theirs conventions, possibilities etc... We end up outsourcing our thinking.

Move away from incremental thinking to possibility. Identify your [[First Principles Thinking]] elements and assemble them, do not build on top of whats working if the whole is inneficient or based upon incorrect assumptions. This opens possibilities to be discovered and generating innovation. [[Innovation accounting]].

[[Analogy thinking]] is good to communicate and understand better, but it has itÂ´s limitations. Analyse the principles of your work and you will decide if the currents methods make sense ot not. [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]]

## When itÂ´s specialy usefull
1. When doing something for the first time. 
2. Dealing with complexity.
3. To understand a situation you are having problems with.

Analogies canÂ´t replace understanding.
