We should learn to identify how the world works and align to those realities. The world is what is teaching us and if we are not going to let it do it, the world will teach us a lesson.

	‚ÄúWhat the pupil must learn, if he learns anything at all, is that the world will do most of the work for you, provided you cooperate with it by identifying how it really works and aligning with those realities. If we do not let the world teach us, it teaches us a lesson.‚Äù

More often than not we think how the world should look like or work like. But the world does not work as we think. And this frustrates us. Why do we not follow how the reality is working? Because we do not usually listen to its feedback. 

It¬¥s very easy and conveninet to blame hthe circumstances or other people when we don¬¥t get the outcome we desire. And this is very time and resource intensive when we could be doing it in much less.

Our feedback usually comes from people, not reality itself. And it¬¥s very difficult to get good feedback from people as they don¬¥t want you to feel bad, emotions get in the way. And even if they get you a few tips that are usefull the hard-truthts are barely spoken. On top of that there is the problem that most people know more or less the same amount that you do.

The other source is trough insititutions, groups, society etc. but that is more [[Incrementa thinking]] than [[First Principles Thinking]] depending on wha tyou want to build it might be easy but it might not lead to anything new.

The best way is to focus on the outcomes, your outcomes, leavening the ego behind. [[validated learning]] or [[Build Measure Learn feedback loop]] are good ways to get started.
