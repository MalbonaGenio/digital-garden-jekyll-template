# Value and Growth

Most importat [[Leap of fatith]] are:
- Value creation hypothesis , is it value-creating or value-destroying.
- Growth hypothesis. Avoid [[success theater]], growth trough fund-raising and not develop a value-creating product. Usually early startups donÂ´t have enoguh data to make an educated guess like a traditional or established Businesses. Which is not inherently bad. This gut hypothesis needs to be translated into data.
