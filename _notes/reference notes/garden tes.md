We should learn to identify how the world works and align to those realities. The world is what is teaching us and if we are not going to let it do it, the world will teach us a lesson.


	‚ÄúWhat the pupil must learn, if he learns anything at all, is that the world will do most of the work for you, provided you cooperate with it by identifying how it really works and aligning with those realities. If we do not let the world teach us, it teaches us a lesson.‚Äù
	
	‚Äî Joseph Tussman

More often than not we think how the world should look like or work like. But the world does not work as we think. And this frustrates us. Why do we not follow how the reality is working? Because we do not usually listen to its feedback.
