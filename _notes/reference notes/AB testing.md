# AB testing
A way to test identical functionalites in different designs to your customers and see how is the interaction between them. You can find that one way of showing a feature might work well in one case and not being so utilized in another. 

It can also uncover that some features that were thought as a good aproach are not interacted by the customers. Resulting in a need to test [[Strategy and assumptions]] and seek a deeper understanding of why that feature isnt been used, no matter how presented. Also [[AB testing]] is a way to add a layer of validation to your product development and get [[validated learning]] from the new build features. Deciding if the idea was worth the effort used. If the idea is not good after validation it should be removed from the product [[Value vs Waste]].
