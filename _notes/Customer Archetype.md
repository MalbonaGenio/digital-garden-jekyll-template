Numberes are compeling story tellers, but at the end metrics are people. Even in large organizations the end consumers is always a person. A succesfull sale model breaks down this monoliths into individual that make them up.

Everything that you need to know about your customer,market, suppliers etc is outside of your building. So the first step to validate your [[Leap of fatith]] is to see if the are based in reality, a problem worth solving. Sometimes you donÂ´t need to seek early adopter that know your tech but mainstream customers and see if there is a larger manstream audience where you could build a significant business.

Early contact with customers is to understand the potential customers and their problems. Not to seek definitive answers. Then build am archetype of the customer to humanize it. This will serve as guide for the [[product development]] ensuring that the decisions made align with the need of our archetype customer target.

Remember that the customer archetype is just an hypothesis too, not a fact. This profile has to be validated trough [[validated learning]]. 

To build what the archetype points us too we can use [[desing thinking]], [[interaction desing]] or newer techniques like [[lean UX]]
