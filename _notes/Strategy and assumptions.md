# Strategy and assumptions

For Businesses, the role of strategy is to figure out the rigth questions to ask.

A business plan is a set of assumptions, and they are usually false. So there is a need to validate them as quickly as possible.
- Test the assumptions systematicaly.
- Test them extensively without losing sight of the company vision.

Acting as if assumptions are true is a [[Leap of fatith]]:
- Yield big opportunities if they are really true.
- Bring the startup to a risk of failure if fasle.

These leaps of faith ususally are presented as arguments of analogy. But they obscure the leap of fait. These usually are used to make the business less risky. When we should state that what should be done is some empirical testing first. Make sure that customers are eager to embrace the product. Even if the analogy seems sound in our head, itÂ´s necesary to ask if the analogy hold up. And if this analogy was created to convice investors that this is good idea to build the new product following the success of the one in the analogy.

## Analogs and antilogs
Basing an strategy on comparisons (to companies or industries) is not intrisicaly wrong. 

See the iPod, an analog would be the Walkman. Sony didnÂ´t had an analog for the leap of faith that was personal music consumption trough earphones.

And antilog would be Napster. Why would people pay for music when napster is free. Are people willign to pay for music? This creates a trail of unanswered questions to guide your business.
