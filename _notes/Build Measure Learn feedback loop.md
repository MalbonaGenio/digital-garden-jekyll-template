Status: ðŸŒ±

Businesses turn ideas into products, customers generate feeback an data when using products. Feedback can be qualitative or quantitative.

Ideas > Build > Product > Measure > Data > Learn > Ideas

ItÂ´s not about each individual piece but how fast we can get trought the whole loop.

- Build is an [[MVP]] at the begining, enable the first loop. Lacks many things but must be able to measure its impact.
- Measure these efforts to see if they are translating to real progress. Allows us to create [[learining milestones]]. Keep in mind [[Vanity metrics ]] and [[Actionable metrics ]].
- Learn from the date mesured and decide to [[pivot]] or not. If the hypothesis we are working are false is time to change to a new strategic hypothesis.

Activities happen in the order above, but the planning happens the other way around. 
- What do we need to learn?
- Figure out what we need to measure to see if we get [[validated learning]].
- Figure out what product we need to build to experiment an do the measurement.
