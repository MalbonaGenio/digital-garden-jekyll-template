Market research and talking to customer  can bring up two kinds of dangers:
- [[just-do-it ]] aproach where you donÂ´t spend enough time in strategy or talking to customers. This can lead to delude that we are on the rigth path. Because customers donÂ´t really know what they want.
- analysis paralysis when we endlessly refine our plans. Talking to customers, research reports, etc. 

The problem is ususally that the facts were the whole strategic principles are wrong. These facts can only be found between the interaction product-client. ThatÂ´s why the [[MVP]] is so important as it allows us to see the interactions and plan on them.
